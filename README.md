# My goal with each game I make is to make a game that I have not made before. That way I make new scripts that I can use in later games.
# Expanding my script library and makes future games earlier.
# For example, I have a menu system for level based games.
# A prototype inventory system not finalized in this game.
# A menu system for rpg and other save file games, still needs the final pieces.
